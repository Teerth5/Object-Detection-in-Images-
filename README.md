1st Technique : Using Yolo v9 for object detecion on Custom dataset

YOLOv9 is very new. At the moment, we recommend using a fork of the main repository. The detect.py script contains a bug that prevents inference. This bug is patched in the fork.
Installing the roboflow package, which I will use to download our dataset from Roboflow Universe.
In the YOLOv9 paper, versions yolov9-s and yolov9-m are also mentioned, but the weights for these models are not yet available in the YOLOv9 repository.
